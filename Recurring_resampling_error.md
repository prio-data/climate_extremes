# Expanding on a Recurring Issue: Resampling and Masking

## Resampling and Masking  
When you resample a raster, you're creating a new grid with finer or coarser resolution based on the original raster. The new gridâ€™s cells are resized compared to the original cells. For example, if you resample a raster by a factor of 3, the original cells are subdivided into 9 smaller cells (in a 3x3 grid).  

A mask is a boolean grid (same resolution as the raster) used to filter out or mark specific areas of interest. This mask typically identifies areas of the raster with valid data (`True`) or invalid data (`False` or `NaN` for missing data). When resampling, the mask should align with the resampled raster so that only valid cells are used for resampling operations, and invalid cells remain excluded.  

However, issues arise if the mask is derived from the original grid, and you resample that original grid. Here's why:

## The Root Cause of Misalignment  

### Misalignment of Grids  
After resampling, the new raster's resolution is finer, which means you now have smaller cells within the same bounding box. But since you're using the original raster's mask (designed for the coarser grid), this mask will no longer fit exactly with the new raster. The finer resolution raster has different boundaries, so the mask may not align correctly to the finer grid cells.  

In other words:  
- The original mask may cover a large region (since it was based on the coarser grid cells).  
- The new resampled raster will now have many more cells that represent the same area, but the mask won't scale automatically to match the new resolution.  

### Valid Mask Misalignment  
The original raster's valid mask might indicate areas of valid data and invalid data at a coarse resolution, but once you resample, the mask needs to be resampled in the same way as the data. This ensures the valid/invalid distinction remains accurate for each finer cell.  

If the valid mask is not reapplied or resampled properly, several issues may arise:  
1. The resampling process might use invalid data (or leave gaps in data) in areas where the mask says the data should be valid.  
2. The finer grid might end up with spatial misalignment where valid areas on the original grid are incorrectly marked as invalid (or vice versa).

## More Specifically  

### Resampling Method and Masking  
When you perform resampling, the method you choose (e.g., bilinear, cubic) may try to interpolate the values of neighboring cells. If the original cells have null values or missing data, the resampling method may propagate these null values into the newly resampled cells unless you explicitly exclude them from the interpolation process.  

For example:  
- A coarser raster with missing data resampled using bilinear interpolation might assign interpolated values to finer cells.  
- If neighboring cells also have missing data, this could result in larger areas of missing data than originally present.  

### When the Mask Doesn't Align  
Consider this scenario:  
- The original raster has cells with valid data, but those valid cells may not exactly match the boundaries of the finer resampled raster.  
- If the original valid mask (from the coarser raster) is applied to the finer resampled raster without adjustment, valid and invalid areas may become misaligned.  

#### Example:  
- The original mask has one valid cell, and surrounding cells are null.  
- After resampling, that valid cell is divided into nine smaller cells.  
- Without a rescaled mask, some of these finer cells might be incorrectly treated as valid or invalid.  

A properly rescaled mask ensures that only the valid data is used for interpolation and no new invalid data is introduced.

## Conclusion  

### Key Issues:  
1. The mask must be resampled alongside the data to match the new finer grid.  
2. Without proper rescaling, areas marked invalid in the original raster might be treated as valid in the resampled raster, leading to errors.  

### Solutions:  
- Ensure both the data and the mask are resampled with the same grid size.  
- Resample the mask to the finer resolution, maintaining valid and invalid regions, so that the resampling of the data follows the mask boundaries.  
- Avoid interpolating over null values to prevent introducing invalid data.

## Summary  
Misalignment occurs when the resampling process changes the raster's resolution but fails to correctly adjust the associated valid mask. Without resampling the mask, you risk introducing new null areas or misclassifying valid/invalid cells. This can lead to errors in downstream processes, such as zonal statistics or other spatial analyses, where invalid data is improperly considered valid or vice versa.
