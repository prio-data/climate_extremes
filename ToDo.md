1. Approve the filename structure of:
    - The output climate extreme CSV.
    - The Summary PDF.
    - Incorporate broad summary statistics into the PDF.
2. (Optional) Incorporate an activity log tracking meaningful attributes about which processes have recently been computed and the considered parameters to aid quick reference about which variables (and respective parameters) are prepared for a batch 'ingestion.'

3. This needs to be an ADR!
