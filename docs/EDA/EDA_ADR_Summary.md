### EDA Tasks
1. **Grid Alignment Analysis**:
   - Compare boundaries and resolutions of 250x250 and 50x50 grids.
   - Identify misalignments and overlap issues for resampling.

2. **Spatial Variation Examination**:
   - Evaluate variability and trends in the original 250 km grid.
   - Visualize the spatial autocorrelation to assess suitability for kriging.

3. **Resampling Factor Exploration**:
   - Test different resampling factors (e.g., 15, 20) and their impact on alignment with 50 km grid boundaries.

4. **Interpolation Comparison**:
   - Compare bilinear resampling and kriging outputs.
   - Quantify differences in mean, variance, and spatial patterns.

5. **Uncertainty Analysis (Kriging)**:
   - Evaluate prediction variance from kriging to identify areas of high uncertainty.

### ADR Tasks
1. **Input Data Validation**:
   - Ensure consistency of 250 km grid values and ancillary datasets (if used).

2. **Resampling Method Selection**:
   - Establish criteria for selecting bilinear or kriging based on spatial variation, computational cost, and accuracy.

3. **Grid Aggregation Workflow**:
   - Define the process for averaging kriged outputs back to 50 km resolution.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Define metrics (e.g., RMSE, bias) for evaluating resampling quality against the 50 km target resolution.

5. **Scalability Testing**:
   - Test workflows for scalability to larger datasets or global grids.
