# Technical Debt Report (TDR): Advanced Spatial Resampling Methods

## Context
- Current resampling relies on **bilinear interpolation**, which is computationally efficient but lacks the ability to:
  1. Capture spatial trends beyond immediate neighbors.
  2. Incorporate external variables that influence spatial distributions.
  3. Estimate uncertainties associated with interpolated values.

## Proposed Improvements
1. **Kriging**:
   - Implement **ordinary kriging** to leverage spatial autocorrelation for more accurate predictions.
   - Provide uncertainty estimates (e.g., prediction variance) for areas with sparse data.

2. **Co-kriging**:
   - Use ancillary datasets (e.g., elevation, vegetation) as covariates to refine predictions.
   - Integrate multiple layers of spatial information for more realistic outputs.

3. **Regression Kriging**:
   - Combine regression models with kriging to incorporate deterministic trends (e.g., temperature vs. altitude).
   - Address complex spatial dependencies and improve predictive power.

## Implementation Path
1. **Short-Term**:
   - Conduct exploratory analysis to validate the feasibility of kriging on the 250 km and 50 km grids.
   - Compare kriging outputs with bilinear resampling for key metrics (e.g., RMSE, bias).
   
2. **Medium-Term**:
   - Develop a pipeline for integrating ancillary datasets into **co-kriging**.
   - Identify and preprocess relevant covariates (e.g., DEM, land use maps).

3. **Long-Term**:
   - Deploy a scalable workflow for **regression kriging**, integrating geostatistical models with external predictors.
   - Evaluate the approach on larger or global datasets.

## Anticipated Benefits
- Enhanced spatial accuracy in resampling outputs.
- Improved alignment with the 50 km grid by incorporating global trends and ancillary data.
- Quantifiable uncertainty metrics to inform decision-making.

## Challenges
- **Computational Demand**: Kriging, especially regression kriging, requires significant computational resources for large datasets.
- **Data Preparation**: Ancillary datasets must be carefully curated and aligned to the primary grid.
- **Model Validation**: Spatial models must be rigorously validated to ensure reliability.

## Future Opportunities
- Extend kriging methods to global-scale applications.
- Explore machine learning approaches to augment spatial predictions where geostatistical methods are computationally prohibitive.
