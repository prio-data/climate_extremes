### Summary Statistics and Graphics
- **Current State:**  
  Summary statistics and graphics are basic and lack aesthetic appeal. At present, they are designed to serve as quick references for completeness and provide an overview of the data.  
  - **Limitations:**  
    - Unprofessional appearance.  
    - Minimal visual coherence or advanced stylistic elements.  
  - **Future Consideration:**  
    Revisiting this aspect for enhanced professionalism and design quality is recommended if a polished product becomes a priority.

### Opportunities for Improvement
1. **Global Summary Statistics:**
   - **Location:**  
     Found in the `global_summary_stats.py` function.  
   - **Potential Enhancements:**  
     - Expand the scope of calculated statistics.  
     - Improve the presentation of summary outputs for clarity.  

2. **Graphics Consistency and Presentation:**
   - **Location:**  
     Graphics are produced in the scripts `etccdi_to_pg__pointquery` and `etccdi_to_pg`.  
   - **Issues Identified:**  
     - Individual graphics lack a unified legend scale.  
     - Multiple legend scales clutter the layout.  
   - **Suggested Improvement:**  
     - Implement a **shared legend scale** for all graphics to improve visual coherence.  
     - Limit the display to a **single legend** across all visuals in the layout.
